#### 1. Overview <a name="summary"></a>
In this project, we analyze user-article interactions on the IBM Watson Studio platform and make various recommendations to users on which new articles they may like.The types of recommendations we explore in this project include: rank based recommendations, user-user based collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization.

Rank based recommendations will be an analysis of the most popular articles based on the most interactions. Without any ratings to use, we will assume articles with most interactions are most popular.

User-user based collaborative filtering will look at user-article interactions and look for similar users on the basis of which similar articles the original users have interacted with. 

With matrix factorization, we will look at a machine learning approach to building recommendations. We will build out a user decomposition using the user-item interactions to get an idea of how well we can predict new articles for an individual to interact with.
