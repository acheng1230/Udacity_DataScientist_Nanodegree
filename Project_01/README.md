#### 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


#### 2. Data <a name="data"></a>
This data was purchased from [BigDataBall](https://www.bigdataball.com/) and encapsulates:

- NBA 2018-2019 Player Box Scores
- NBA 2018-2019 Daily Fantasy Scores

	
#### 3. Business Questions <a name="business_questions"></a>
For this project, I was interested in using Fantasy Basketball data to better understand:

  1. What are the key drivers for top fantasy scores?
  2. What positions offer the most value from a fantasy score perspective?  
  3. What trends can be observed during the NBA season from a fantasy score perspective?

 
#### 4. Results <a name="results"></a>

The results of the analysis can be found on this Medium [post](https://fastbreakdata.com/3-tips-on-winning-in-fantasy-basketball-c5243d32605c).
